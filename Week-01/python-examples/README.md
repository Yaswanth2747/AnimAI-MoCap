# Python Examples
Go through all these 11 files one after the other in order, they explain most of the basic syntax and data structures of Python.

Even if you are completely new to Python, all these files can be covered within **2â€“3 days**.  
Run each program, observe the output, and try tweaking the code a little, this will help you understand the concepts much better.

> If you're already familiar with Python, you can **skip this part** and directly move to learning `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `pandas`, and start working on **Assignment-01**.

**Credits**  
The Python examples used here were shared with us by a friend who took the DSA course at the Computer Science Department, IIT Bombay. These resources have been very helpful for understanding and practicing basic Python.
