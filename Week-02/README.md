# Week 2: Machine Learning Fundamentals | Seasons of Code - AnimAI Project

Welcome to **Week 2** of the **Seasons of Code (SoC) - AnimAI** project!  
This week, we'll build upon our ML fundamentals. Please refer to the PDF titled **`Intro_to_ML.pdf`** attached in this directory — it covers most of the basic concepts in machine learning.

However, just reading won't do the trick. We've also included **`Assignment-02`**, which is a very basic and standard assignment in ML. Please make sure to complete it.

> **Submission Deadline for Assignment 2:**  
> `04 June 2025` EOD

For this week (and the next), we’re planning to add another hands-on assignment, **`Assignment-03`**.  
It will cover more ML fundamentals and serve as a bridge toward our further goals: **image processing**, **computer vision**, and **animation**. This will be made available by **Saturday**.

If you find any issues with the PDF or the assignments, feel free to reach out to us.  
Thank you and happy learning!
Your Mentors.
