Hey everyone!

This week, we're diving into Fourier Series, Fourier Transforms, and motion capture techniques.

Most of the work is already set up in Week3.py.
You just need to complete the remaining tasks and build on top of it.

Deadline: by 12 June 2025 (EOD)

As always, feel free to reach out if you need any help.
