## 📅 Week 3: Fourier Series, Transforms & Motion Capture

Hey everyone!

This week, we're diving into **Fourier Series**, **Fourier Transforms**, and **motion capture techniques**.

Most of the work is already done in `Week3.py`.  
You just need to complete the remaining tasks and build on top of it.

> **🗓️ Deadline:** 11 June 2025 (EOD)

If you haven’t completed **Week 2** yet, we recommend catching up before moving ahead. We will come with another assignment in this week and we will inform you about it.

As always, feel free to reach out if you need any help.
