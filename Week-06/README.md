# Week 06: Bidirectional LSTM for Missing Frame Reconstruction | SoC 2025 AnimAI

In this final week, we explored learning based motion reconstruction using **Bidirectional LSTM networks**. Unlike spline or average interpolation, we used both past and future context to predict the missing frame in a video sequence.
This work builds a natural connection between traditional frame filling and data driven video modeling.

The full implementation, a few things to reflect on are available in the file **`mocap_interpolation_model.ipynb`** in this directory.
